# jmm2025pep
first example repo created at Professional Enhancement Program

The readme file is a "markdown" file (.md). So you can make things **bold** by enclosing in double asterisks or *italics* by enclosing in single asterisks.  Hyperlinks are added by putting the title in brackets followed immediately by the hyperref in parantheses. For example, we are using the book [GitHub 4 Mathematicians] (http://g4m.code4math.org).

By replacing .com with .dev in the webaddress for the REPO you access the editor (which is just VSCode in a browswer).
