# jmm2025pep
first example repo created at Professional Enhancement Program

The readme file is a "markdown" file (.md). So you can make things **bold** by enclosing in double asterisks or *italics* by enclosing in single asterisks.  Hyperlinks are added by putting the title in brackets followed immediately by the hyperref in parantheses. For example, we are using the book [GitHub 4 Mathematicians] (http://g4m.code4math.org).

By replacing .com with .dev in the webaddress for the REPO you access the editor (which is just VSCode in a browswer).

I was unable to connect to codespaces while in the conference hall due to "Network Error" but others could. It's possible that CPP protocols are the issue.

Codespace creates a virtual computer in the cloud (60 hours per core allocated per month for free) to run your programs. You can edit and run your program and then push & sync the changes to the repo to save it.  You should close the codespace down when you are not using it because it will exhaust your available resources when you are "not using it."
